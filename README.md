On the flipkart seller portal, there is no option to download transaction history with the customer name

For filing VAT returns, the customer name is needed.

If the seller has a folder of past Flipkart Label PDF files, i.e files that contain the shipping label and
customer invoice, then this utility will be of utmost use.

It takes the directory path of the PDF files as an input, and generates a file called "name-invoice.csv" that contains
the "Invoice Id" and the corresponding "Customer Name".

This will save the seller the manual task of opening up each invoice and associating the invoice id from the
transaction history (downloadable from http://seller.flipkart.com) with the customer name mentioned inside the
PDF label file
